# ðŸ§  VocaGraph â€“ Visualizing Vocabulary in NLP

> An interactive notebook project to build and visualize word co-occurrence graphs from natural language text using Python and NLP.

---

## ðŸ“„ Description

**VocaGraph** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) notebook that demonstrates how to extract, process, and visualize word relationships in the form of graphs. It uses `spaCy` for language processing and `networkx` for constructing co-occurrence graphs. This tool is ideal for analyzing how words relate in textual data and provides a powerful visual insight into contextual proximity.
